### What is it?
Think back to the classic game Asteroids. How can your ship move forever in your finite rectangular universe?
        The vertical pair of edges and the horizontal pair of edges are effectively glued together.
        If you think about it, gluing the horizontal edges and then gluing the vertical edges makes a doughnut or a torus.
        In BRAP, you can get more than just a doughnut. In fact, you can get all 4 topological surfaces that can be defined with a rectangle and all 4096 possible universes. Every 15 seconds, the 'wrapping' will change. If you played for 17 hours straight,
        you still might not BRAP in them all!
